This project will solidify your understanding of React and Redux while giving you a chance to express your creativity. Youâ€™ll practice improving the predictability of your applicationâ€™s state; establish strict rules for getting, listening, and updating the store; and identify what state should live inside of Redux and what state should live inside of React components.

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React & Redux course in egFWD Advanced Web Development Nanodegree.
